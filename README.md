This site is built with [hexo](http://hexo.io/). Site content is written in Markdown format located in `src`. Pull requests welcome!

## Developing

``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm start # dev server at http://localhost:4000
```

## Deploying

The site is automatically deployed when commits land in `master`, via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

If you are the maintainer of a community translation fork and would like to deploy via Netlify instead of GitHub pages, please ping @tumayceber in an issue to request a Netlify team membership and DNS update.

## On Translations

Translation for this documentation project are currently maintained in separate repositories forked from this original one.

### ~~French~~
### ~~Mandarin~~
### ~~Russian~~
### ~~Spanish~~
### ~~Turkish~~

### Want to help with the translation?

If you feel okay with translating sorta alone, you can fork the repo, create a "work-in-progress" issue to inform others that you're doing the translation, and go for it.

If you are more of a team player, Translation Gang might be for you. Let us know somehow that you're ready to join this international open-source translators community.

And thank you in advance ;)
